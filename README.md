# Employee-Attendance-App


## **Overview**  
The Leave Management App is designed to streamline the process of managing and tracking leave requests for employees. It ensures a smooth user experience by following Clean Architecture principles, maintaining reusability, and providing a responsive UI aligned with modern design standards.  

---

## **General Guidelines**  
- **UI Development**:  
  - The app UI is developed based on provided designs, adhering to the colors, fonts, and theme used in the existing project.  
  - Repetitive elements are extracted into reusable widgets/components to ensure modularity.  

- **Code Quality**:  
  - Clean, readable, and well-documented code is written to ensure maintainability.  
  - The project strictly follows **Clean Architecture principles** to separate business logic, UI, and data layers.
